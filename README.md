# Blood Donation Sentiment Analysis

This is an Analysis that characterises whether a person will or will not Donate blood in the month of March. 
The ML algorithms that are used to prove the analysis are - 
- Logistic Regression
- SVMs
- Random Forests
- Decision Trees
- Multi-Level Perceptron

SKLearn Library has been used to implement the Machine Learning Algorithms.
The SVM, i.e. the Support Vector Machine gave us the maximum accuracy score that is 78.4 %.

The Dataset has been extracted from the  [Udemy Machine Learning course](https://www.cluzters.ai/Course/1306/learn-machine-learning-10-projects-in-finance-health-care). We have two datas, which are contain the Training and Testing data.

My Supporting Handwritten notes regarding the Syntax / Database Structure / Pipeline are also uploaded just in case.
